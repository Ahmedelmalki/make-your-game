# Make Your Game

## Description
With the passing of time and the evolution of technology, boredom is harder to escape. To combat it, you’ve decided to create your own game using **JavaScript** and **plain HTML/DOM**, without any frameworks or canvas. The challenge? Achieving smooth, high-performance gameplay at 60 FPS!

This single-player game project focuses on building a custom engine and tools from scratch, while keeping the game responsive and optimized.

---

## Objectives
Key features of the game include:
- **Smooth Animation**: Runs consistently at **60 FPS** without frame drops.
- **Pause Menu**:
  - Continue
  - Restart
- **Scoreboard**:
  - **Timer**: Displays elapsed time or countdown.
  - **Score**: Tracks player’s points or XP.
  - **Lives**: Displays remaining lives.
- **Optimized Rendering**: Minimal use of layers for better performance.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Smooth and responsive player controls without stutter or jank.
- **No Frameworks**: Built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and the DOM.

---

## Instructions
- The game must maintain **smooth animation** by leveraging `requestAnimationFrame` for all updates.
- **Player Controls**:
  - Key press actions should respond smoothly.
  - Holding a key should trigger continuous action until released.
- **Pause Menu**:
  - Implement options to pause, restart, and continue the game without frame drops.

## Tools and Techniques
Recommended tools for development:
- **Page Inspector**: Modify and debug layout/content.
- **Web Console**: Track `console.log` outputs and interact with the page.
- **Performance Tool**: Analyze FPS, frame drops, and function execution times.
- **Paint Flashing**: Identify rendering issues.

---

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, you will:
- Master `requestAnimationFrame` for animations.
- Understand the **Event Loop** and how to avoid jank animations.
- Learn about FPS optimization and DOM manipulation.
- Utilize browser developer tools effectively.

## Tasks
1. Implement smooth and responsive animations.
2. Create a scoreboard for time, score, and lives.
3. Develop a pause menu with options to continue and restart.
4. Optimize game rendering for consistent 60 FPS performance.
5. Ensure all logic is implemented with **plain JavaScript and DOM**.
